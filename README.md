# Computer-Architecture
The project contains simulation results and python code for computer Architecture concepts such as memory hierarchy, branch prediction, cache organization and associativity.
The resources used for simulation project are VMware 16, Ubuntu 1604, and SimpleScalar. In this project I ran the linux commands in simplescalar tool to learn the difference between ISAs (PISA and ALPHA Intruction Set Architectures), how memory hierarchy and branch prediction helped improve the CPU speed etc,.
The part 2 of the project involves python code with Numpy and Pandas packages to define a dynamic memory table and run the direct mapped and set associative caches. This explains how set-associative cache is more flexible in performance than direct-mapped cache.
There is a pdf containing the whole report the project.
